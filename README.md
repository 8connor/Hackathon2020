                    Trash Bandit is a game that brings awareness about recycling.
                    The Trash Bandit website acts like a community leaderboard to support recycling in your community.
                    The more your community recycles, the more points every player from that community obtains monthly.
                    These points can be used to get cosmetic items for your character in-game.
